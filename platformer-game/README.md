# Platformer Game
In my first semester I developed this jump and run game in the game engine Unity.

Challanges I faced were:
- Logic of the movement system
- Camera transitions when entering another room
- Light emission and shadow casting

It can be played using this link: https://d3rw0mb4t.itch.io/platformer

The controlls for the player are:
- WASD directional buttons
- Space to jump, double jump and wall jump
- Left Arrow for attacking
- Down Arrow for dashing
