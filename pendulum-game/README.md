# Pendulum Game
Game I developed in my freetime in school which does not make use of the inbuilt physics engine instead using my own implementation of a physics engine. The toughest challange was implementing the phyiscs for the ropes.  

The game can be played using this link: https://d3rw0mb4t.itch.io/pendulum  

In the game the user controlls a red circle which can attach a rope to the background using left mouse button. The game does not have an objective, it is meant as a fun project exploring physics simulations.  

The game is written in C# and uses different scripts to controll objects in the game. The PlayerScript controlls the players physics, SpawnScript is used to place the different objects in the world for the player to interact with like the yellow boosts, the purple bouncy thing or the gray spike that slows the player down and cuts the rope.
