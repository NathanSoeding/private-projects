# Pendulum Game
Game I developed in my freetime in school which does not make use of the inbuilt physics engine instead using my own implementation of a physics engine.  
The toughest challange was implementing the phyiscs for the ropes.  

The game can be played using this link: https://d3rw0mb4t.itch.io/pendulum  

In the game the user controlls a red circle which can attach a rope to the background using left mouse button. The game does not have an objective, 
it is meant as a fun project exploring physics simulations.
